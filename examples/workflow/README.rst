FEM case study 
==============

This example is based on the paper by Mobini et al. (dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2821).
It is meant to show the workflow when designing a FEM study.

Run
---

Simply run

.. code::

        python3 study_case_study_cg.py


or generate a reusable mesh file and run the study without using SALOME (benefitial for studies using the same mesh)

.. code::

        salome -t Mesh_chamber.py
        python3 study_case_study_cg_mesh.py

The results will be stored in a directory named :code:`results`.

Visualization
-------------

ParaView files to reproduce figures can be generated by opening ParaView 5.6 and choosing the respective :code:`.pvsm` file from the :code:`paraview` directory in the :code:`load state` dialog.
Note that you have to choose the files again as ParaView stores absolute paths.
You can use the filename as such, but have to navigate to the :code:`results` and :code:`mesh` directory that will be created during a successful run.
The line plots have been generated by gnuplot scripts (.gnu). The plotted .txt files were previously exported from ParaView.
