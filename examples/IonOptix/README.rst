Simulation for "Osteoblast behavior upon electrical stimulation in vitro"
=========================================================================

The results of this simulation were presented at the ESB2019 in Dresden by Susanne Staehlke.

Run
---

Simply run

.. code::

	python3 study_ionoptix.py

The results will be stored in a directory named `results`.

Visualization
-------------

ParaView files to reproduce the figures on the poster can be generated by opening ParaView 5.4 and choosing the .pvsm respective file in the `load state` dialog.
Note that you have to choose the files again as ParaView stores absolute paths.
You can use the filename as such, but have to navigate to the `results` directory that will be created during a successful run.
